# aliu8708-tracker

- Pop up was the first difficulty encountered but easily overcame it with provided resources in week 13
	
- Experimented a lot for the timer function but ran into lots of difficulties trying to under the code especially it used external scripts for it jquery 
	○ Wanted to keep it simple and use only plain javascript
	○ Issues with spamming start button causing the timer to speed up and not able to stop or reset it. Can be fixed by adding a verification function that checks if the function is already running but tbh not feasible within my abilities
	○ Interval is not reliable and there can be lag within the system causing inaccuracy with timer
	○ With calendar, could convert time into 12 hours and convert the date into displaying actual month
	○ With more time, can calculate totals of rep like originally intended
	○ Global tracker variable being reset every time, therefore I could not achieve this.
    o Modal with multi modals could not be achieved, therefore view your reps and reps added confirmation page could not be achieved.
