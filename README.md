# aliu8708-tracker

Concerns
- Pop up was the first difficulty encountered but easily overcame it with provided resources in week 13
- Experimented a lot for the timer function but ran into lots of difficulties trying to under the code especially it used external scripts for it jquery 
    -  Wanted to keep it simple and use only plain javascript
	- Issues with spamming start button causing the timer to speed up and not able to stop or reset it. Can be fixed by adding a verification function that checks if the function is already running but tbh not feasible within my abilities
	- Interval is not reliable and there can be lag within the system causing inaccuracy with timer
	- With calendar, could convert time into 12 hours and convert the date into displaying actual month
	- With more time, could calculate totals of rep like originally intended
	- Global tracker variable being reset every time, therefore I could not achieve this.
    - Modal with multi modals could not be achieved, therefore view your reps and reps added confirmation page could not be achieved.

Future Aspirations and Goals
- Learning the backend of web dev has definitelty been an eye opening experience for me as Intro to Web Dev caught my a lot of my interests. I do wish to continue learning web development and perhaps pursue a career in it.

- If provided more time, there would of been lots of changes to how i would of approached developing this web app such as starting early.
     - Better time management skills needed to improve for myself and future
     - Have the courage to ask for assistance and not stop let myself challenge myself too extreme
